TNG Short List
==========
- replace SampleSegment -> SampleTrackSegment
- replace tco -> segment, TCO -> Segment, Tco -> Segment

- Split code that generate BeatLists into a MetricMapWalker class that can have
two subclasses.  One used directly by sequencer when synthesizing, The other
used to generate BeatLists
- Make TimeLine display
- Add insert meter/tempo support to TimeLine
- Start working on sequencer code

SongEditor:
- Better clone support
- Ability to place markers on the time-line
- Key-signature in the time-line??
- Better copying of Segments.
- Slice through all TCOs at a specific time?

PianoRoll:
- Add slicer(march, swing, 16ths,..) and arp-recording
- Gray out notes not in the key-signature
- Allow placing chords

Look for all TODO! and TODO{TNG} comments.

Version 1
=========

New features:
-------------

- new powerful and universal Resource framework
  * ResourceBrowser [60%]
  * save Resource references in projects rather than fixed filenames
  * QuickLoad feature
  * full web integration [40%]
- rewrite TrackContainerViews to use QGraphicsView framework
  * "paintbrush" tool for the song editor, to easily "paint" beat+basslines
  * somehow enable easy pattern copy pasting in the beat+bassline editor
- new Sequencer infrastructure
- full recording functionality:
  * Automation recording: [40%]
	* when you record and there is already an auto clip, it repeats it
	* it freezes when you try to do it with the Volume or Panning slider
	* crashes when you try to do it with a solo/mute button
  * Audio
  * MIDI
- MIDI export
- FX mixer sends
- Redesign undo/redo framework. Make sure every aspect of the program has undo
  and redo support, including song editor, beat+bassline editor, piano roll,
  automation editor, fx mixer, etc.
- basic LV2 support [40%]
- MidiControlListener [50%]

Changes/improvements:
---------------------

- make pitch bend range adjustable [100%]
- select number of channels in export-project-dialog - ????
- add/remove-steps button in bb-editor for adding/removing according 
  number of steps to/from all patterns of visible beat/baseline. (translation:
  adding/removing steps to the beat+bassline editor is awkward. Make it more
  like FL Studio)
- the 'add beat+bassline' button in the beat+bassline editor is misleading.
  I say we remove it and rely on the song editor to add beat+basslines
- remove binary-embed-system for plugins (Qt4-resource-system?)
- level-meters in output-graph and instrument-track
- add FLAC as export format
- show instruments in both B+B and song editor. you can't have an instrument
  in one and not another.
- when you switch the playback option it should immediately switch which thing
  is playing
- when you clone a track, it should put it directly below, rename it to #2, and
  not have it in the song
- cloning a track in the song editor should copy automation tracks along
  with notes
- FlpImport:
  * convert FL-Plucked!-parameters to Vibed-parameters
  * correctly load steps/dots from FLP-files
  * merge play-list-items if possible
- support for VST presets


Version 2
=========

- new GUI framework for subwindow layout etc.
- PianoRoll:
  * rewrite (QGraphicsView framework based)
  * add a tools menu to piano roll
	* quantize tool in the piano roll
	* put some of the tools on there that already have keyboard shortcuts
      (ctrl+up/down, shift+left/right)
	* humanizing tool
	* quick slice
	* look through FL Studio's tools and implement some of them
    * chord editor
  * show key presses when
  * don't end mouse selection when control is released
- AutomationEditor:
  * rewrite
- tempo-recogn. and sync of beat-samples
- monophonic mode for 3xosc
- AudioFileProcessor:
  * rewrite
  * Slicing
  * re-pitch at constant length
  * sample-key-mapping
- classical score editor



Rejected/needs discussion:
--------------------------

- restore stacking-order of windows when loading project
- right click in b+b should delete notes 
- right click on note volume draws a line not deletes notes in the piano roll
- default the graph to On. change the default length to 64 or even 32 but
  make it a setting, whether it's on and how many samples.
- when a song goes past the end of the song, make it stop or loop
- when looking at a piano roll, if the song is playing that pattern, move
  the position ticker to where it should be. allow user to change the position
  ticker which modifies the song position relatively.
- add dithering ???
